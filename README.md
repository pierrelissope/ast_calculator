# Calculator with Tokenizer, AST, and Analyzer

This repository contains a fully-functional calculator implemented using a tokenizer, an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and an analyzer. The project is designed to demonstrate the core concepts of lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and semantic analysis in building a basic arithmetic calculator.

## Features

- **Tokenizer**: Breaks down mathematical expressions into tokens for easy parsing.
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: Represents the hierarchical structure of parsed expressions.
- **Analyzer**: Evaluates the AST to perform calculations and return results.

## Getting Started

To get started with this calculator, clone the repository and run the main script. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pierrelissope/ast_calculator.git
cd ast_calculator
./ast_calculator
```

## Example Usage

```bash
Enter Your Math Expression: 3 + 5 * (2 - 8)
Result: -27
Enter Your Math Expression: (((6 * 5) + 67 * 89) * (93 - 34))
Result: 353587
```
